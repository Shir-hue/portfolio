# My Portfolio 👋

I'm **Percival Ignacio Jr.**, this is my personal portfolio website. I built this to share my journey as an aspiring software engineer and showcase the projects I've been working on.

## What's This About? 

I'm currently studying for my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Roehampton (starting 2025) and just finished a Higher Diploma in Software Engineering at Lithan Academy in Singapore. This website is basically my digital home where I put everything I've learned and built so far.

## Contents

- **My Story**: A bit about who I am and what I'm passionate about
- **Skills I'm Learning**: The technologies I've picked up (and still picking up!)
- **Projects I've Built**: Things I've created while learning to code
- **How to Reach Me**: If you want to chat about tech, opportunities, or just say hi

## Tech Stack 🛠

I kept it simple but effective:
- **HTML5 & CSS3** - The foundation (with some cool animations I learned!)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - For all the interactive bits
- **EmailJS** - So people can actually contact me through the form
- **Font Awesome** - For those nice icons
- **Google Fonts** - Because it's perfect

## Cool Features I Added 

- **Responsive Design** - Works on your phone, tablet, whatever
- **Smooth Animations** - I spent way too much time perfecting these
- **Project Filters** - You can sort through my work by technology
- **Working Contact Form** - Actually sends emails (without backend. interesting)
- **Dark Theme Ready** - Because i love dark mode
- **Scroll Progress Bar** - Shows how much you've scrolled through

## Want to Run This Locally? 💻

Super easy:
1. Download or clone this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. That's it! No fancy build tools needed

**Pro tip**: If you have VS Code, just use the Live Server or Live Preview extension for hot reloading.

## Making It Your Own 🎨

Feel free to fork this and make it yours! (Would be really good if credited) Here's what you'd want to change:

**Personal Info** (in `index.html`):
- Update the hero section with your name and title
- Replace my story in the about section
- Add your own skills and experience
- Update the contact info

**Styling** (in `assets/css/style.css`):
- Change the color scheme (look for the `:root` variables)
- Swap out fonts if you want
- Adjust animations to your taste

**Projects** (in `assets/js/script.js`):
- Replace the projects array with your own work
- Update the filtering categories
- Add your own project images


## A Few Things I Learned 📚

Building this taught me a lot:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox aren't as scary as they seem
- Vanilla JavaScript is actually pretty powerful
- Good UX design takes time (and lots of tweaking)
- Responsive design is harder than it looks
- Animations can make or break the user experience
